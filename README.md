# Trigger-Word-Detection
Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
For this project, our trigger word will be "activate". Every time it hears you say "activate", it will make a "chiming" sound.
